# Python Functions and Class Implementation


This repository contains several Python functions and a class that perform various simple tasks. Below is a list of implemented functions and their descriptions.

## Functions

- Returns the sum of the two numbers.

### 2. `is_even(number)`
- Returns `True` if the number is even; otherwise returns `False`.

### 3. `reverse_string(text)`
- Returns the reversed version of the input string.

### 4. `count_vowels(text)`
- Returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the input string, case insensitive.

### 5. `calculate_factorial(n)`
- Returns the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`. Raises a `ValueError` for negative inputs.

### 6. `apply_decorator(func)`
- Takes a function as input and applies a decorator that prints "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

### 7. `sort_by_age(tuples_list)`
- Sorts a list of tuples by age (second element) in ascending order.

### 8. `merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)`
- Merges two dictionaries. If a key exists in both dictionaries, their values are summed.

## Class
